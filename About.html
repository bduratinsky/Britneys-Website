<p class="aboutText"> We got our start selling bakery items as kids. My cousin and I would often hold bake sales on our driveway. People from all over the neighborhood (and neighborhoods nearby) would come for our sweet treats!! When we got older my cousin and I decided we wanted to do something we both really enjoy and that is baking! We bought a small shop, fixed it up, perfected our childhood recipes, and began our dream!</p>
